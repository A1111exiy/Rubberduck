<hr>

I've been using VBA for as long as I can remember, but never knew anything other than a Making-It-Work coding style. I didn't give any thought to structuring my code. Needless to say, I wasn't progressing <s>very fast</s> at all. That changed early last year when I decided to improve my coding knowledge. I luckily found Rubberduck, and it’s taught me more in a year than I’d have been able to discover flying solo. Through using Rubberduck and hanging out at the the [war pond](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/14929/vba-rubberducking) I’ve been able to
- Understand the differences between `ByVal` & `ByRef` through [Code Inspections](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/wiki/Code-Inspections).
- Learn about and successfully writing [Unit Tests](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/wiki/Unit-Testing) that allow me to make changes without fear of unintentionally breaking functionality.
- Understand the differences between Early and Late binding.
- Learn and use [Dependency Injection]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).
- Programming to an abstraction and not a concretion.
- How to properly Refactor code.
- Write Self documenting code (comments should explain the why not what).
- Achieve consistent indentation.
- Referencing external assemblies.
- And a gaggle of other stuff too...

In addition to being a user of Rubberduck, I’m also a contributor. To show my appreciation for what RD and all other ducks at the pond have helped me learn I took the initiative to learn C# and help with the codebase. When I first started I didn't think I'd be able to successfully contribute, <i>hint hint</i> [anyone can contribute](https://rubberduckvba.wordpress.com/2017/02/21/up-for-grabs/). Just remember that you #GottaStartsSomewhere.
